In this project, an Unscented Kalman Filter is utilized to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

As shown in the figure below, the obtained RMSE values for estimated position and velocity are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. The red and blue dot are the lidar and radar data point and the green dot is the estimated position of the object.
